## Syllable.swipl
* defines onset, rhyme. What makes a valid english syllable
```
?- findall(X, syllable(X), Y).
-> giant list of syllables
-> number of syllables > number of words

?- findall(X,syllable(X), Y), length(Y, Length).
Length = 20608
```

# Syllables in Japanese
onset: cns
nucleus: not(cns(X)). (any vowel)
coda: nas(X) (only a nasal)
```
:- ['properties.swipl'].

onset([A]) :-
	phone(A), cns(A). %any sound that is a consonant
onset([]).

nucleus([A]) :-
	phone(A), not(cns(A)).

nucleus([A, B]) :-
	nucleus(A),
	nucleus(B). % two nuclei in sequence is an allowable nucleus
% NOTE: This causes infinite recursion. This will be adressed on Friday

coda([A]) :-
	phone(A), nas(A).

coda([]).

rime(A) :-
	nucleus(B),
	coda(C),
	append(B, C, A).

syllable(A) :-
	onset(B),
	rime(C),
	append(B,C,A).
